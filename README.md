# DDOS-Attack-Simulation-and-Machine-Learning-Model-for-Intrusion-Detection-
* In this project we used ParrotOS to simulate a DDoS attack. Parrot OS provides a huge arsenal of tools, utilities and libraries that IT and security professionals can use to test and assess the security of their assets in a reliable, compliant and reproducible way.
* The NSL KDD Dataset is analysed using numpy, pandas, sklearn, matpoltlib and seaborn libraries. We have used Jupyter notebook to make the analysis. In order to build an effective anomaly detection system, a refined version of the KDD ‘99 Dataset is used as it offers a sizeable amount of features, while being efficient in getting rid of redundancy. Machine Learning Algorithms are developed to check the effectiveness of Anomaly detection using Python. The relationship between division of labels and effectiveness of the algorithms has been analysed while focusing on Feature Selection and Feature Engineering in order to improve the models. Similar machine learning models are used throughout and f1-scores and accuracy are used as metrics of evaluating the results. Analysis is made mainly using Python’s sci-kit learn library.
